# HolaCloud Console

This is the console UI for the [hola.cloud](https://hola.cloud/) service.

It contains all the static files served from [console.hola.cloud](https://console.hola.cloud) plus some mock endpoints.

## How to run

As simple as:

```sh
make run
```

It will start the service on the default port (http://localhost:8080) and also will setup static dir to load changes from disk without recompile each time.
